## Description
The project represents a stopwatch. Button "Start/Stop" - starts/stops the time countdown, stops and resets the timer value.
"Wait" - works on a double click (the time between clicks is no more than 300 ms!) The timer must stop counting; if you click start after it, the countdown resumes.
"Reset" - resets the timer to 0. It resets the timer and starts counting again.
